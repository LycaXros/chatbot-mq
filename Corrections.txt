Some small comments.

API url is hardcoded, it's recommended to move to a config.
It's recommended to use an external library to parse the CSV instead of doing Split(",").
It's recommended to rename IBotStockRequest interface and BotStockRequest class in order to support more commands also the method SearchStock on these and the queue BOTSTOCKQUEUE name.
